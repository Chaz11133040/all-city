                If you're looking to see some good art and you don't mind going off the beaten track a bit, maybe
                climb a fence or two. There's no better place to look than the dark corners of our city, the forgotten
                buildings, abandoned warehouses, and hidden streets. I'm going to show you some of the places
                I've been hanging out recently.
                <br>
                First is the burnt-down Queenslanders across the road from the Annerley McDonald's. Once you've
                found a way past the fence, you'll find a busted-up old house covered in art. In fact, there's some
                particularly bad stuff on one wall that my mates did as teenagers back when they lived next door.
                This place has been around forever. Legend has it that the building burnt down, but because it's
                heritage-listed, they can't knock down what's left to build something new. It's so wrecked that
                trying to fix it would be basically impossible. So it just stands as an urban exploration landmark.
                Hot tip: if you explore here, don't go upstairs. It might collapse at any moment; you have been
                warned. But the best art is downstairs in the blue room. Someone has come through and painted
                the whole thing baby blue and thrown up some mad art.

                Next is an abandoned warehouse next door to the legendary Laserforce. Just off the main road,
                make your way through two fences and duck under a security camera to find yourself in front of a
                wall of art. Inside, people have had a few parties and smashed the joint up a bit. Upstairs, you can
                see the remains of the fire that left it abandoned. If you're in the area, come in and put something
                for me to see next time I'm in. Maybe it will land in one of these articles.
